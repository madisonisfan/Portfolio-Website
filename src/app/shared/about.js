export const About = [
  "I'm a junior software developer based in <strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>. My passion for coding sparked back in high school and has only grown stronger since. Through a mix of courses, college experience, and completing a full stack bootcamp, I've become skilled in web, mobile, and backend development. Although I'm comfortable with all three, I've found my focus in <strong>front-end development</strong>.",

  "What excites me most is the power of coding to <strong>turn ideas into reality</strong> and create innovative solutions. I've recently built and <strong>launched a mobile app</strong>, which gave me valuable hands-on experience in bringing projects to life.",

  "Aside from coding, I'm also deeply committed to fostering growth and support within the tech community. I've been actively involved in volunteering with <strong>Women Who Code</strong>, where I contribute to creating an inclusive environment and empowering fellow developers.",

  "<strong>I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and make a lasting impact!<strong>",
